## My first Ludum dare submission!

Developed a complete Unity game in 48 hours based on the theme "Limited Space". Created gameplay, 
art, and effects for an asteroid-style game featuring diverse enemies.

At first its seems like any other ordinary space game but wait â€¦ space shrinks!!! Maneuver the spaceship between asteroids and aliens and save space.
